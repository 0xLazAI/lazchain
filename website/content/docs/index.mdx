Metis SDK is redefining the landscape of blockchain scalability, performance, and usability, addressing the pressing demands of the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem. As decentralized applications (DApps) continue to gain traction, the need for infrastructure capable of handling massive transaction volumes, lightning-fast processing speeds, and frictionless user experiences has never been greater. Metis rises to this challenge by introducing the SDK solution to deliver unparalleled throughput, ultra-low latency, and seamless transaction finality.

## Key Features of Metis SDK

- **Modular Architecture**: Metis SDK is an open-source modular framework designed to provide Web3 developers with a powerful foundation for innovation. It provides plugin features, you can choose according to your needs.
- **High Performance**: Leverages [MetisVM](crates/vm/README.md), [MetisDB](crates/db/README.md) and [Parallel Execution](crates/pe/README.md) technologies to deliver low-latency, high-throughput on-chain operations.
- **Strong Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting Solidity smart contracts while simplifying DApp migration.
- **Scalable Consensus Engine**: Supports customizable Sequencer networks, which can be either decentralized or centralized, depending on the specific use case.
- **Decentralized Sequencer**: For Layer 2, the Metis Sequencer Network consists of multiple decentralized sequencers, each responsible for transaction ordering, validation, and state commitment.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 network configurations, tailored to diverse application needs.
- **AI Features Support**: Use [Alith](https://github.com/0xLazAI/alith) AI agent framework to provide AI related on-chain or off-chain tasks including data processing, model inference, fine tuning, etc.

## Metis SDK Based Blockchains

The Metis SDK has given rise to a new generation of blockchains, each tailored to address specific needs within the Web3 ecosystem.
