The year 2025 is poised to be a watershed moment, heralded as the convergence of AI and Web3 is 
redefining the boundaries of technological innovation.
At the core of this transformation stands Metis SDK, a groundbreaking framework engineered to
address fundamental AI and Web3 challenges, establishing itself as an indispensable tool at this
critical intersection of technologies.

## The Problem Landscape

The integration of AI and Web3 faces critical roadblocks:

- **Scalability Limitations**: Existing blockchains struggle with AI-driven workloads, constrained by low throughput and high latency.
- **Centralization Risks**: AI services often rely on centralized infrastructure, conflicting with Web3's decentralized ethos.
- **Data Fragmentation**: Siloed datasets and opaque AI processes hinder trust and interoperability in decentralized applications.
- **Complex Development**: Building AI-native DApps requires navigating unrelated tools for smart contracts, agent framework, model deployment, and data orchestration.
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Training and inferencing AI models on-chain demand unsustainable computational costs under traditional architectures.

To address these issues, we have launched Metis SDK â€” a framework dedicated to building an open, transparent, high-performance, and secure AI + Web3 ecosystem.

## What is Metis SDK?

Metis SDK is redefining the landscape of AI and blockchain scalability, performance, and usability,
addressing the pressing demands of the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem. As AI decentralized 
applications (DApps) continue to gain traction, the need for infrastructure capable of 
handling massive transaction volumes, lightning-fast processing speeds, and frictionless 
user experiences has never been greater. Metis rises to this challenge by introducing the 
SDK solution to deliver unparalleled throughput, ultra-low latency, seamless 
transaction finality and AI native features.

## Why Metis SDK?

Metis SDK stands out as the optimal choice for developers venturing into the AI + Web3 space. 
It combines a modular architecture with high-performance components, making it adaptable to a 
wide range of applications. By supporting AI features  and ensuring strong compatibility with 
the Ethereum ecosystem, Metis SDK lowers the barrier to entry for developers.

### Key Features of Metis SDK

- **Modular Architecture**: Metis SDK is an open-source modular framework designed to provide Web3 developers with a powerful foundation for innovation. It provides plugin features, you can choose according to your needs.
- **High Performance**: Leverages [MetisVM](crates/vm/README.md), [MetisDB](crates/db/README.md) and [Parallel Execution](crates/pe/README.md) technologies to deliver low-latency, high-throughput on-chain operations.
- **AI Execution Extension**: Use [Alith](https://github.com/0xLazAI/alith) AI framework to provide high performance and low cost on-chain or off-chain tasks including data processing, model inference, fine tuning, etc.
- **Strong Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting the latest Pectra specification and Solidity smart contracts while simplifying DApp migration.
- **Scalable Consensus Engine**: Supports customizable Sequencer networks, which can be either decentralized or centralized, depending on the specific use case.
- **Decentralized Sequencer**: For Layer 2, the Metis Sequencer Network consists of multiple decentralized sequencers, each responsible for transaction ordering, validation, and state commitment.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 network configurations, tailored to diverse application needs.
