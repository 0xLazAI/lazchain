Metis SDK is redefining the landscape of blockchain scalability, performance, and usability, addressing the pressing demands of the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem. As decentralized applications (DApps) continue to gain traction, the need for infrastructure capable of handling massive transaction volumes, lightning-fast processing speeds, and frictionless user experiences has never been greater. Metis rises to this challenge by introducing the SDK solution to deliver unparalleled throughput, ultra-low latency, and seamless transaction finality.

Metis Hyperion is a next-generation **Layer 2 Ethereum solution** based on Metis SDK, designed to empower decentralized applications and businesses with **scalability, low-cost transactions**, and a user-centric ecosystem. By leveraging advanced technologies like **Optimistic Rollups** and **Decentralized Sequencers**, Metis aims to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain networks while maintaining the core ethos of decentralization and security.

## Key Features of Metis SDK

- **Modular Architecture**: Metis SDK is an open-source modular framework designed to provide Web3 developers with a powerful foundation for innovation. It provides plugin features, you can choose according to your needs.
- **High Performance**: Leverages MetisVM, MetisDB and parallel execution technologies to deliver low-latency, high-throughput on-chain operations.
- **Strong Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting Solidity smart contracts while simplifying DApp migration.
- **Scalable Consensus Engine**: Supports customizable Sequencer networks, which can be either decentralized or centralized, depending on the specific use case.
- **Decentralized Sequencer**: For Layer 2, the Metis Sequencer Network consists of multiple decentralized sequencers, each responsible for transaction ordering, validation, and state commitment.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 network configurations, tailored to diverse application needs.
- **AI Features Support**: Use [LazAI](https://lazai.network) and [Alith](https://github.com/0xLazAI/alith) to provide AI related on-chain or off-chain tasks including data processing, model inference, fine tuning, etc.

## Metis Hyperion Structure

The entire structure of Metis Hyperion Layer 2 is designed around several algorithm loops which are designated to mitigate the potential damage and filter the possible malfunctions of decentralized actors and/or other outer ill-wishers.

There are 7 distinguished actors participating in the system (Governance Protocol is a part of L1 / Smart contract, but it handles a number of functions that make it a separate entity):

1. **User** sends the transactions;
2. **Sequencer Node** is responsible for correcting the blockchain, propagating the blocks through the Peer Network;
3. **Metis Blockchain** is an entity held by Decentralized Sequencer;
4. **Verifier** is the counterpart of Sequencer, mostly responsible for keeping an eye on the Sequencer to not provide false/invalid data;
5. **L1 Smart Contracts** â€” the set of smart contracts that handle the security of the system, solve the disputes between Sequencer and Verifier;
6. **Memolabs** stores the transaction data;
7. **The Governance Protocol** is responsible for anything related to the efficiency of the system.
