    <Accordion title="What is Metis SDK?">
        Metis SDK is redefining the landscape of blockchain scalability, performance, and usability, addressing the pressing demands of the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem. As decentralized applications (DApps) continue to gain traction, the need for infrastructure capable of handling massive transaction volumes, lightning-fast processing speeds, and frictionless user experiences has never been greater. Metis rises to this challenge by introducing the SDK solution to deliver unparalleled throughput, ultra-low latency, and seamless transaction finality.

    <Accordion title="What is a Decentralized Network?">
        In a decentralized network, control is distributed across multiple participants rather than being concentrated in a central authority. This ensures:

        - **Resilience**: Prevents single points of failure.
        - **Security**: Guards against malicious attacks by spreading control across the network.
        - **Transparency**: Enables open and verifiable operations.
        - **Censorship Resistance**: Protects against undue influence or restrictions by centralized entities.

        Metis is pioneering decentralized infrastructure by integrating advanced governance and **Decentralized Sequencers**, enabling a robust and equitable environment for blockchain applications.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is Metis L2?">
        Metis is an Ethereum Layer 2 leveraging innovative technologies such as Decentralized Sequencers and off-chain storage for empowering a sustainable Web3 economy.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How does Metis Maintain a Consistent Uptime?">
        The system is designed in a way that any malfunctioning actor gets charged and swapped out through the constant cycles of rotation. It is accomplished with the Peer Network which includes Sequencers, Verifiers, and Consensus (PoS) layer. After the next major upgrade, there will be no more downtime at all, and the maintenance schedule will be controlled by the community through the governance protocol.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is the Peer Network?">
        It is a network of decentralized actors (nodes) that serve the Metis system. Anyone can become a part of the Peer Network just by setting up a node on their computer. The participants of the Peer Network receive revenue with a portion of the fees from all the transactions that go through the Peer Network.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is Merkle Tree State Root / Merkle Tree Transaction Batch Root (MTSR/MTTBR)?">
        It is a hashing algorithm which is aimed to identify the inconsistencies between the nodes (or participants of the Peer Network in our case). Merkle tree is created by dividing data into many pieces, which are then hashed repeatedly to form the Merkle Tree Root. You can efficiently verify if something has gone wrong with a piece of data.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where does Metis store the transaction data?">
        Metis stores the transaction data in Memolabs storage, which is based on blockchain technology to provide safe, efficient, and large-scale decentralized cloud storage services.
    </Accordion>

     <Accordion title="What Version of Ethereum is Metis Compatible With?">
        Metis has support for the Pectra upgrade.
