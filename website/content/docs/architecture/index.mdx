title: Architecture Overview
---

Metis SDK has established a robust and innovative architecture to ensure high performance, scalability and compatibility in its Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 network. The following provides an expanded overview of its core components:

## Core Components

- [**Parallel Execution**](/sequencer/architecture/pe):
   - The Metis Executor is a high-performance executor that processes transactions in parallel, significantly increasing throughput and reducing latency.
- [**Metis VM**](/sequencer/architecture/vm)
   - A custom-built virtual machine that executes smart contracts and transactions on the Metis Layer 2 network.
   - It is optimized for performance and compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts, enabling developers to deploy their applications easily.
- [**Metis DB**](/sequencer/architecture/db)
   - A high-performance database optimized for storing and retrieving transaction data, state roots, and other relevant information.
- [**AI Execution Extension (AI ExEx)**](/sequencer/architecture/ai_exex)
   - Provides foundational support for on-chain AI applications through a set of innovative technologies designed to make AI-driven decentralized applications feasible and efficient.
