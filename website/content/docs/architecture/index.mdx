title: Architecture Overview
---

Metis SDK has established a robust and innovative architecture to ensure high performance, scalability and compatibility in its Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3 network.

Specifically, Metis SDK provides a **parallel execution engine**.
Instead of processing transactions one by one, it uses multiple CPU cores to execute them _concurrently_, aiming to significantly **speed up block processing**.
It manages shared data carefully using a _multi-version memory system_ and coordinates tasks with a _scheduler_.
It can optionally use _JIT/AOT compilation_ to further accelerate smart contract execution and allows integrating custom extensions like an _AI service_.

## Core Components

- [**Metis VM**](/architecture/vm)
  - A custom-built virtual machine that executes smart contracts and transactions on the Metis Layer 2 network.
  - It is optimized for performance and compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts, enabling developers to deploy their applications easily.
- [**Metis DB**](/architecture/db)
  - A high-performance database optimized for storing and retrieving transaction data, state roots, and other relevant information.
- [**Parallel Execution**](/architecture/pe):
  - The Metis Executor is a high-performance executor that processes transactions in parallel, significantly increasing throughput and reducing latency.
- [**AI Execution Extension (AI ExEx)**](/architecture/ai_exex)
  - Provides foundational support for on-chain AI applications through a set of innovative technologies designed to make AI-driven decentralized applications feasible and efficient.
